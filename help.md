This insight shows the geographic distribution of users and enables
segmenting users by country. Individual countries and continents can
be focused by entering their names in the input field above the map.

When segments are selected, the data on the map is filtered by the
intersection of segments (i.e. users who belong in all selected
segments). New user segments can be created by clicking on a
country on the map or a bar in the top countries chart below.

Note that the total numbers on shown on the map may differ from
the size of the selected segment since location data might not be
available for all users.

**Example 1:** Select a segment of your most active users (from
[Activity Distribution](/explore/bitdeli/activity-distribution)) and
further segment it by two countries on the map. By comparing these
segments with [Characterize](/explore/bitdeli/characterize) you can
see how your application is used in different countries.

**Example 2:** If the color scale on the map is thrown off by a
single country on the map you can examine other parts of the world
by entering multiple continent names (e.g. "Asia", "Europe") in the
input field above the map.
