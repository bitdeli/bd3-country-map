This insight shows the geographic distribution of users and enables
segmenting users by country. Individual countries and continents can
be focused by entering their names in the input field above the map.

When segments are selected, the data on the map is filtered by the
intersection of segments (i.e. users who belong in all selected
segments). New user segments can be created by clicking on a
country on the map or a bar in the top countries chart.
